### Cafeteria Terminal

The cafeteria order terminal runs also an Android application receiving from the
customer app the ordered quantities of available products (for simplification letâ€™s
assume that the available products are only: coffee, soda drink, popcorn and
sandwich) and at most two vouchers used in the price calculation. After validation
of the vouchers the terminal should show an order number, products ordered,
vouchers accepted and final price to pay. The customer then collects the products in
another place at the cafeteria, when the order number is called.
